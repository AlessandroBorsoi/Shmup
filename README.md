SHMUP
=====

This is the source code of "SHMUP" a 3D Shoot 'em up that I wrote in 2009.  It
is very inspired of Treasure Ikaruga, the engine runs on iOS, Android, Windows
and MacOS X.  It has also been ported to Linux by "xevz".

The main project page is at [http://fabiensanglard.net/shmup/](http://fabiensanglard.net/shmup/)

Technical side
==============

It is written in ANSI C with wrapper for the specific platforms, rendition is
done with OpenGL ES 1.1 and there is even an experimental rendition path based
on OpenGL ES 2.0 that uses the dEngine source ( which can be found here:
