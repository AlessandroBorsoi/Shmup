This is the source code of "SHMUP" a Shoot 'em up that I wrote in 2009.
It is very inspired of Ikaruga, the engine runs on iOS, Android, Windows and MacOS X.
It is written in ANSI C with wrapper for the specific platforms, rendition is done with OpenGL ES 1.1 and there is even an experimental rendition path based on OpenGL ES 2.0
that uses the dEngine source ( which can be found here: http://fabiensanglard.net/dEngineSourceCodeRelease/index.php).
